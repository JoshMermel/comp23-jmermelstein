These programs were written by Josh Mermelstein for comp23.

Laser.py renders lasers moving from the bottom of the screen to the top.

Battlecruiser.py renders a battlecruiser which can be controlled with the arrow
keys and can shoot a laser with space.  The s key fires extra fast for those
who need cheats.  Speed in x and y directions is capped but not normalized so
you can move faster on diagonals than stright.

Enemy.py renders 10 mutalists bouncing around on a white background.

game.py is the full game.  It renders a battlecruiser which can fight mutalisks
with lasers until one of them collides with it.
